           Reflection on <i>The need for Global Internet Connectivity</i> by Daniolou. 
        </span>
        <p>
            The reading starts of by exploring how connection is a human need, being able to connect to otheres is important for humans
            to be happy and how th einternet and access to the internet can greatly affect whether or not a human can connect with others
            espesially in th e current age. The reading speaks about how everything being digitized due to the pandemic has changed the way people could
            connect. On one hand COVID highlighted areas that had a lack of access to digital technologies and on the other because technology 
            was espesial during this time it pushed its development and the need for these technologies to be accessible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The article talks about introducing internet into rural communities. On one hand this may be a good idea because it could mean that more people
            would be able to create knowlege and ave access to knowledge, this could mean that systems of knowledge that are diffrent from the conventional ones 
            can be better preserved. It would also have a positive effect in terms of representation provided people are commited to voicing their stories 
            and creating. Howeveer a potential issue is that this exposer to global knowledge or rather westernised meadia could lead to some cultures going 
            extinct. Another issue I have around the project is the issues of consent (is this something that the people living in these places) and education, 
            if this technology is being given to people who have previosly not been exposed to it they need to be educated on internet literacy.

            Reflection on <cite>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic.</cite> by Kasapis
        </span>
        <p>
            The reading talks abou how it should be a human right to have access to the internet. This was reminiscent of one of the past weeks readings
            in that it reflected the ideal of the internet; equal access to information and how this is still something that needs to be worked towards. The 
            article talks about how the pandemic brought to light the unequal access people have to the internet and how this presents an opportunity to remedy 
            this. However I think access is only the first step to treating the actual problem the next step being education, people need to know how to use
            these tool to better themselves in a productive way. Having access to knowledge and information is no doubt important but 
            with the prevalence of misinformation online people need be able to think about whether or not the information being presented to them is reliable 
            or not.

        <p>The <i>Traveling while Trans</i> reading was really eye opening. It brought to light issues i had never really 
        considered before, and while I'd like to think I'm not completely ignorant to issues of social justice, I 
        had never even considered how (adminastative) digital systems worked to harm minorities. Another idea that 
        I found thought provoking as well as a 
        bit worrying, was the possible repercussions normative programming may have on AI and the possible unbalance this would cause or 
        even  the danger that this 
        could create for those who don't neatly fit into the predefined boxes. The idea of normative programming and the way it sort of reveals our or 
        societal bias espesially when it comes to AI developement and such reminded me of post that a friend reposted on their instagram stoty. The post was 
        talking about coding bais and to illistrate its point it used the Palestine Israel conflict. ChatGPT was separtly asked whether or not each of the two deserved to be free, or something 
        along those lines, to which ChatGPT gave very deffrent answers. <details>post go here</details> And while I genrally remain optimistic about the developementof adminastative   
        I feel that in order to reach the best possible outcome humanity has to be carefully considering the choices we need to be making during this 
        time.    <details>Reference:</details></p>

        <span>Reflection on “The Road to Technocolonialism” by Verdi 2020</span>
        <p>
            The article is about how AI is being developed predominantly by and within countries that have large amounts of power 
            and how this further solidifies said countries influence and dominace on the rest of the world. It talks breifly about AI used in millatry
            developement which reminded me of this article titled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22983197/ai-new-possible-chemical-weapons-generative-models-vx">"AI suggested 40,000 new possible chemical weapons in just six hours"</a>
            and how the possiblity of using AI to harm humanity is a very real threat. The article mentions or hints at the potential power stuggle that 
            could happen between powers (mainly America and China) as they both work to develope their AI technology and how this could filter down into other
            aspects of the globe. Potential creating a divide within the world. It also states how countries lacking in the infrasturture needed to participate
            in the developement of AI will be placed at a great disadvantage and will essentailly be left at the mercy of 
            countries or companies that do. The concept of AI potentially resulting in a "New Dark Age"(Verdi, 2020) remided me of a substacks article I read
            recently titled "AI is a Shoggoth" that speaks about the potential danger of AI and how it could plunge humanity into a dark age. <details><a href="https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/ai-is-a-shoggoth" target="_blank">AI is a Shoggoth</a>In order to view the full article does require a Substacks account
            but I think it well worth a read.</details>
            The reading takes this in a diffrent direction in that not being able to partake in AI development may mean that some nations and places will experience a dark age. AI could make 
            an already unbalanced system even more unbalanced. The reading also highlights the importance of data as 
            a sort of currency but also the importance of educating people about cybersecurity, privacy and how to keep their personal information safe. The reading
            mentions a case where Zimbabwe sold her citizens biometric data to a Chinese company, this really struck me I think that this could be extremely dangerous
            and also I wondered if citzens had given their consent to this and if they realize what giving their consent means in this case, I find it equally as shocking that this wasn't a major new story.

        <h6>MAKING A FEMINIST INTERNET IN AFRICA: WHY THE
            INTERNET NEEDS AFRICAN FEMINISTS AND FEMINISMS</h6>by Sheena Magenya
        <p>
           The reading starts off discussing how the pandemic highlighted the fact that there is unequal access to the internet. 
           The author then goes on to talk about how the voices and presence of groups that represent people who typically "exist
            on the margins of normative societies"(Magenya, 2020) has increased online and the subsequent response this has garnered. Online spaces have reflects the oppression and violence that minority groups
           experience and often times this harm will be conducted by a small group of people who are very loud. The author then goes on to say that 
           African feminists (as well as other marginalized groups) need to have more presence online and how it is important that these people create online
           because one it creates knowlegde and provides a resourse for others who may have similar experiences and secondly then these groups can 
           work towards fighting oppression through representing themselves.  

        </p>
        <p>
            The reading also talks about the issue of representation and how it is important that African voices begin to build the narritive around their
            experience and existence rather than the narritive of Africa being controlled by the west. Again an emphasis is put on the importance of creation, 
            and how in creating itself Africa can shift the narritive. Magenya speaks about how Africa is considered a "beneficiary of technology,
            not an innovator of it"(Magenya, 2020) but this is not the case it is just that these stories aren't being told but they need to be. The complexity 
            of African lives needs to be expressed and online spaces present a great way of getting these stories and voices to be heard.

        <p>The Graham et al. reading points about the coraillation between power and knowledge or more specifically the creation and control of knowledge. 
            I was intresting to see graphs illistraing how things are skewed. I think the graphs are really helpful in fully articulating* the problems around
            information and content creation in a way that is really easy to understand. Anoter point that breifly mentioned in the lecture video was about 
            how if you do not have an online presence you become invisabile. Its intresting how this idea or fact works in almost every level of human society today,
            what I mean by that is that if you don't have a social media presence it will affect you socially, if a business doesn't have a website it will have an
            effect on how well the business does and in a more global sense if a country is not online creating content it doesn't take up space in the global
            consciousness. I think in this regard it is really important for Africa as a continent to encourage her citizens to create online as opposed to 
            just consuming. I am of the oppinion that it is incredibly important for human knowledge to be as diverse and inclusive as possible if we as a species 
            want to prosper.            
         </p>
         <p>
            The reading also mentions the idealist hope for the internet. That it would be a place were information could be equally accesseible
            and that everyone would be able to contribute to the wealth of human knowledge, but rather there are massive companies that essentailly
            control information, both access to it and its creation. This reminded me about the Cambridge Analitic scandal and how dangerous misinformation 
            can be espesially when used as a weapon inorder to achieve a goal. It points out the importance of educating people on digital literacy. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In terms of my website: I wasn't to happy with my site, I think I need to think a bit more about planning. My main goal is to make it as 
            playful and cute as I can! I really need to think more about the colour pallet. In the end I want to incorporate a lot of specially made artworks
            however I'm not sure if this will be possible or not. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I also wanted to breifly talk about my website in terms of this weeks lecture because due to my overall intentions and the artistic direction I'm 
            going with the site I thought it maybe intresting to discuss some of the thoughts I had regarding it after engaging with the lecture. 
            Since the core idea of my website centers around feelings of nostalgia and what the web used to look like I was thinking about how growing up 
            most of the sites I was interacting with, if not all of them, were American or featured media created in the northern hemisphere. While I was 
            thinking about this I was also considering how this would potentially have had an affect on my ideas and thought around what the internet is and 
            how the internet should look. I feel like the abscence of representation on the internet during my time growing up means that my work or idea of the 
            web will always be largely dominated by ideal/ styles/ convetions that I internalised growing up. This is intresting 
            because now I have the awareness to consider ways of going against this inclination to contribute in making the internet a more diverse place.

        I'm havig a bit of a issue with understanding how 
        exactly GitHub is supposed to work, I really feel like 
        I am doing something wrong. 
        My intention with this website, I go into a bit more detail on the 
        portfolio page, is to make the user feel like they are on 
        an website from the old web. 
        In this weeks lecture the idea of ethics was brought up 
        in connection with UI. An idea that really stood out to 
        me in class was the idea that if you are really conscious 
        about the subcounscious behavior/ habits of your users
        you can manipulate them into interaction with your product int
        a way that could be benificial for your own gain. 
        This could also mean you are negatively affecting the user, which
        in the case of basic human decency, is undesireable. However in the 
        name of making a profit is a very powerful thig to understand.

    I enjoy the Html ascpect of building the website the most enjoyable and easy so far. 
    The styling part of the website tedious and confusing
    at times, I find myself confusing classes and such 
    but its a good learning experience. I have been keeping a log 
    of all the problems that I've incountered while working on the website and
    most of the time the issues have to do with styling.
    I don't think my 
    wireframes are entiretly user friendly at the moment
    because they are really just very rough ideas.

   <section><h4>Blog Post 3</h4><p>
    This week we have been introduced to CSS. I find it really interesting
    that websites are made up of so many diffrent interlinked parts. 
    Its like how the internet itself is made up of many diffrent things
    that are linked together to create this amazing web 
    of human knowlege and experience. <details><img src="./images/Internet_map_1024.jpg" alt="" class="InternetPic"></details>
    
    THe video on bad doors was really intresting because 
    it highlights the idea that as a designer you should be 
    making things with the intetion that it will be used 
    by humans. It's also intresting because as of recently 
    I've actually begun to think about certain products and how they 
    have been made without actual functionality in mind. A recent example
    that comes to mind is that I was trying to connect something to 
    the Tv via the HTML port and it was if the TV's design was meant
    to make it impossible to do, the port itself was in the most inaccessible
    place possible and it was really frustrating.

    Going throught the HTML exercise, I'm somewhat surprised
    because it seems pretty simple (I say this now and then struggle), everything
    makes sense and while I know all coding is supposed to be "logical" and make sense
    it really doesn't most of the time, at least in my experience. 
    So far its actually fun to be able to see the thing you want to build
    come into being in real time. 



    <details>I wanted to quickly reflect on the readings week 1:
        I read Garden of Forking Paths, The Libary of Babel and
        As we may think. 
        I really enjoyed Libary of Babel it reminded me of one of 
        my all time favorite works of sci-fi; a short
        story titled The Machine Stops by E. M. Foster, I highly 
        recommend everyone reads it. It also reminded me of the existence of 
        <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/" target="_blank">this website</a> 
        which I stumbled upon a few years ago. I also really enjoyed the 
        Garden of Forking Paths. I found As we may think to be a bit difficult to
        read at times but it was really intresting to see a reasonable 
        imagining of what the future's technology may look like.

       Setting up GitHub seemed easy enough if not a tiny bit confusing.
       I'm not really sure how to use it properly yet but hopefully with some time I 
       will figure it out. I've watched a few youtube videos on it which kinda helped. 

        My personal goal for this course is to become more comfortable
        coding. It's something I really want to be able to do. I also what to 
        learn more about the internet and how to create. 

        We were asked in class to keep track of how often we went onto the internet 
        that day. While I didn't stricly keep track, I estimate that daily I spend 
        about 6 hours online or interacting with the internet 
        a day. I spend most of my free time either doom scrolling
        on some time sucking social media platform or I spend it going down various 
        internet rabbit holes for enjoyment. I also do other things like stream music,
        watch stuff on netflix and most of the work I have to do for university requires 
        me to be online in some capacity.
