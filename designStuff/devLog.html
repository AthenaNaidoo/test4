    <h3 class="Dev">Dev Log</h3>
    <p class="Dev">welcome to the dev log. This page is mostly just for me 
        to keep track of things I need to fix and notes I have for myself.
    
    </p>

    <h3 class="Dev">Fix</h3>
    <p class="Dev">
        Need to fix blog posts: spelling. It's better to 
        plann out text in a word doc rather than just writting it 
        directly in vscode. 
    </p>
    <p class="Dev">
        need to sort out style sheets. Better organise everything
        I feel like its borderline unreadable and it is definitly making things
        inefficient.  
    </p>

    <p class="Dev">
        Fill in figcaptions wireframe page. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="Dev">Notes</h3>
    <P class="Dev">
        theres so much more I want to do.
    </P>
    
    <P class="Dev">
        Having a slight issue with my link generator, I'm not sure how to make it an active link.
    </P>
