            <h3>Design Goals</h3>
            My intention with this website is to create a experience
            that plays on nostalgia and how it relates to having grown up
            being exposed to the internet. I want this website to mirror
            my earliest memorable experiences of interacting with the internet.
            I would also like to explore the ideas of what it
            means to have existed in online spaces as a female growing up and
            how that has had an influence on the way I think and interact with
            the internet as well as the world.

            <h3>Colour pallet</h3>
            I'm going with a mostly pastel colour pallet for 
            the website. The reason is mostly that I want the website to be 
            calming and also I mostly interacted with websites that were soft and 
            pastely when I was younger because that was what I was drawn to the most as a 
            kid. I also wanted to use a colour pallet that’s considered more girly because
             I think that is important to represent the experience of growing up on the web as a girl and those typical 
            spaces. Even though I see a lot more people talking about girly media I still think theres a long way to go in representing 
            women’s experiences.

                Genral Moodboard
            </h3>
            I will link some of the websites I’m inspired by in the fun links section. I just wanted to talk a little bit about 
            the other things this website is inspired by. 
            Kawaii pixel art is one of the things, old sanrio art and games, new super mario bros, other old nintendo ds games, 
            y2k rave posters, neocities and tumblr.

            <h3>
                Discussion 
            </h3>
            I want my website to appear kind of cheesy, 
            like a typical y2k personal website. I want to 
            make it slightly modern in a few way however, 
            those being; I want to make the site a bit more 
            minimalist than it typically would be and I want 
            to make the site appear a bit more refined using features 
            and element that would be incorporate in more modern websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want whoever comes to my website to feel like they are on a personal site made in
             the 2000s or like they’ve come across a neocities site maked to emulate the old web. In line with the 
             theme the user will be presented with the opportunity to explore. One of my personal favorite things about browsing
              neocities is that you never know where you’ll end up or what cool things you’ll discover. I’d also like any visitors to
               feel safe and welcomed, this is another thing I’ve noticed about retro themed sites, I want visitors to explore freely. Most of the elements 
            that encourage exploring will be implemented on my portfolio page. I would like to add other pages, maybe even a pixel art dress up game or a quiz.

        <h4>Fun Page Design</h4>
        <p>
            The fun page in the port folio section is meant to have. Plantwave aesthetic. Plantwave is a variation of vaporwave which was a popular internet sub 
            culture and visual aesthetic in the early 2010s. It is something that I experienced on tumblr while growing up.
        </p>
        <img class="Plantwave" src="../images/PlantWave.png" alt="猫 シ Corp. HQ">
        <p>
            I was largely inspired by the visual style of 猫 シ Corp on of my favorite vaporwave artist.

        <h4>Theme change</h4>
        <p>
            The “dark mode” or the different theme of my homepage is inspired by old personal websites from the early 2000s. The computer angel image was taken from a old website archived on the way back machine linked here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027024209/http://geocities.com/margieberry2002/">Glad to be alive</a> (note when you press the page it downloads some sort of audio file that I’m not really sure about so just be cautious)
        </p>
        <p>
            I also added a WebNeko to the homepage, you can find the page here: <a href="https://webneko.net/">WebNeko</a> it fits the theme of the old web and while I was looking at old pages I discovered it. It is a classic web pet, to interact with it you click on it and it chases your cursor.
