            Hi my name is Athena and welcome to my website.
            I want to create a space/ shrine to the old web. The internet 
            as I experienced it when I was growing up. One of my earliest
            memories of the internet was when my mom took me to work with
            her one day and while she was in a meeting one of her co-workers
            pulled up a typical girly game site called puterdolls! My child brain was 
            completely enthralled with the site as well as the hundreds of dress up games 
            that the site held. I spent many a school holiday glued to my dads computer playing 
            as many of the flash games on the site as I could. The site was my first dip into the 
            vast ocean of the internet. Sadly the site no longer exist.
